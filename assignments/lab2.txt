What happens when starting the lane following demo:
The lane following demo introduces the camera node. The camera node is connected to 
image compression and other nodes and topics that help it recieve input and data for 
the robot to process.

Part IV step 3:
1. /quackdealer/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd

Part IV step 5:
How do the two control topics change? 
- /simple_stop_controller_node/car_cmd
/lane_controller_node/car_cmd

Which topic is used when? 
-/simple_stop_controller_node is used when in manual mode. It is used to stop the car
when not receiving input. /lane_controller_node is used to when in the autonomous lane 
control demo.

How does the fsm topic work within all of this?
- The fsm topic will keep track of which mode the bot is in. That will allow the 
car_cmd_switch_node to know whether the car command should be autonomous or manual.

What do you think this "car_cmd_switch_node" does?
-It switches between manual driving mode and autonomous lane detection mode
